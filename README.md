# Covid Frontline
Connecting those who can help with those who need it the most.

## Problem Overview
India is in lockdown which is unprecedented in scale due to our large population of 1.3
billion people. No section of society has been left unscathed by the coronavirus pandemic. The
poor have been hit the hardest by the lockdown - struggling to get their daily ration/food. People
with compromised immunity systems and other medical conditions, existing prior to
Coronavirus, are finding it difficult to get their medicines on time.

Our problems are in abundance while our resources are limited. Some areas get attention from
multiple NGOs and government bodies while others sometimes get ignored unintentionally.
Thus, there is a need for efficient distribution of resources so that they reach where they are
needed the most and maximum areas are covered. Technology has a huge role to play.

Covid Frontline is an application to connect people who want to help with people who need
it the most during the Pandemic.This allows for efficient distribution of resources even with
limited infrastructure. It seeks to connect people in dire need of resources like food, medicines
or other essential services to local government and associated bodies (like NGOs, volunteers, etc)
providing those services. The request for supplies will be matched according to the district and
state of the person in need to the correct local body - everything will be stored online. In this
way, help reaches where it is needed the most.
